It's about time I had a professional looking blog. So here it is! Props to [this article from Smashing Magazine by Barry Clark](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) for being exceptionally easy to follow! Pretty cool, isn't it? And the use of Markdown make's it exceptionally easy for me to add in code snippets like this:

```javascript
let x = function(){
  console.log("Wow, this is a fantastic blog!");
};
x();
```
